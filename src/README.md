## Data Model

Activities are now stored in `activities.json` for easy management by teachers and administrators:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

### Managing Activities

Teachers can now easily modify activities by editing the `activities.json` file. The system automatically loads activities from this file and saves any changes (signups/unregistrations) back to the file.

All data persists between server restarts.
